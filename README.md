# This is me learning before the learning
Isn't that always fun. Lucky I have chatbots helping me learn. Though that may not help with my attention span

The Goal of this mod: I wanted to learn how to code and how coding interfaces with the game and/or the world. I also didn't want to have to go toiling in the mines and the children no longer yearn for this. So I guess the Ai Intern's can take care of this for me.

The Lore of this mod (WIP): Upon the first light of the World's light the sky was filled with bright balls of light. Shooting across the sky. Magnificent in their glory as they cross the sky only to kiss the earth. However this kiss was not that of sweet pleasantries. This is the story of how the plague brushed across the land and fowled it for all.

WELCOME! Join us... You will eventually
This is The HiveMind! A Minecraft Mod where you will explore the world, coming across new and strange creatures and life forms. Encounter the HiveMind's of this world as they each endevor to gain more power and control over their dominion or take the road less traveled and assume direct control over a HiveMind. Weather you are a feeble drone doing what you can for the collective or push your will against that of the Hive directly and become the dominate personality of the Hive. However this world is not as it seems as there are pressures coming to meet the HiveMind in force. Will you survive or will you be consumed by the HiveMind! (I hear bio-mass has a unique flavor)

The current idea for this mod is to allow the NPC HiveMind's around the world to start off above ground. Then make their way under ground to not only protect themselves but to build themselves up out of sight of the rest of the world. Once the HiveMind get's to a particular level (of intelligence or technology.) Their personality will dictate that they go looking for intelligent life for good or ill. This can also be set by the Player Controlled HiveMind but the progression for this will be different

What's currently set: (Can and will be changed when needed)
- The mod's file structure is set for now (subject to change during the optimization phase)
- Naming schema for classes and function

In progress:
 - The core of the mod is still under active development
 - Drones are spawnable but do not interact with the world yet
 - Roles have been created and will be expanded on
 - Linking system is in place but not final (mostly exists in the CLI)
 - Take-Over system is currently being worked on and being tested (This has been shelved for now as a structural changes are coming soon)
 - Persistence of Drones and HiveMind linking still have some bugs to be worked out

Future Goals: (Bear with me it will be a while before we get to here)
- Fully implement the Drone Roles and have them be adaptible for the needs of the Hive
- Create an Alert Mode system that divert's the Hive's attention to protecting itself by any means necessary
- Implement Personality traits in Drones to allow for a more unique play style
- Expand theme's: Instead of a typical Hive Mind being mostly organic. I want to implement several theme's to make your experience unique. Did you want to be a Bio-Mechanical HiveMind who uses Growth Vats and Manufacturing? I want to make that possible
- Implement cross-mod hooks: Did you ever wonder what a Crystaline HiveMind would do if it could get ahold of Applied Energistics 2 machines and storage drives? I hope to make that possible. Did you want to grow your HiveMind under your MineColonies Colony and having them work in a symbiotic fashion? Why not let's see it. Did you want your Mechanical HiveMind flying up in the sky, flying around the world gathering resources in a Airship. That sounds like alot of fun
- An Ecology: I would like to implement a ecosystem for this mod to allow for the HiveMind's to be balanced. As an Example: HiveMind's will be spread out across the world fighting for resources. Cities will spring up and if the HiveMind is growing to fast or too aggressively then the "Adventurer's Guild" will send a team to eliminate the HiveMind. Or the player can take this on if a HiveMind is threatening them or their lands. But this can also be benefical to the Cities as it could prove to be a valuable training ground for their Warrior's and a great way to improve the Cities Economy.
- Implement a Leveling system. This is to give player's and NPC's (at some point with the right skills) the ability to gauge their ability to either take them on or leave alone.
- Tech Tree: This is to provide a certain level of replayability. I want to have each HiveMind randomly select a initial theme. Then upon leveling up they will get 4 options, 3 options within their theme and 1 in a different theme. To provide a unique experience each time.
