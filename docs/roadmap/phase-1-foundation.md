PHASE 1 – Core Foundations (STATUS: ~85% Complete)

✔ Accomplished
	•	Project structure created in IntelliJ with Fabric 1.20.1
	•	Mod ID, base package structure, and entrypoints set up
	•	Items and basic assets added (including test items)
	•	Basic monorepo layout planning done
	•	Gradle setup largely corrected
	•	Automatic versioning has been discussed and scaffolded
	•	GitHub repo created and connected
	•	Texture work started (e.g., HiveMindAccess item)

❗ Left to Work On
	•	Finalize the monorepo structure (especially shared libraries)
	•	Complete Gradle build cleanup — ensure reproducible builds
	•	Add CI workflow for GitHub (optional for now)
	•	Finish the asset pipeline (final folder conventions for multi-module setup)
	•	Document the entire Phase 1 environment setup in the repo

🎯 Goal of Phase 1:

Make the project compile cleanly, run in the dev environment, and have a stable foundation for all future systems.
