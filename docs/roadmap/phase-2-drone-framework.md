## Phase 2 — Core HiveMind Mod Features (Active Phase)

This is the currently active phase where the gameplay systems, core logic, and mod mechanics are being built.

✔ Accomplished

	•	Created new Debug Mode feature concept and added it to the roadmap.
	•	Updated the full roadmap to reflect the new phase layout.

🔧 Remaining
	•	Implement Debug Mode system in code:
	•	Toggle system (keybind or command).
	•	Debug overlay or console output.
	•	Entity scan, block scan, HiveMind node visibility.
	•	Finalize HiveMind Access Item texture (work in progress in separate chat).
	•	Formalize progression structure and define which mechanics are core vs optional.
	•	Implement the base progression engine (XP system or node-unlock logic).
