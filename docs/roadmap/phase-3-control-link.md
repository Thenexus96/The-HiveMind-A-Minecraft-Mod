## Phase 3 — Systems Development & Expansion

These are the large-scale systems that make the HiveMind mod unique.

✔ Accomplished
	•	None yet — phase not started.
	•	Initial spitballing on Living Systems variants and research unlock paths.

🔧 Remaining

Major systems to build include:
	•	HiveMind Network System (core identity)
	•	Node Types (spawner nodes, resource nodes, brood nodes, etc.)
	•	Infection Mechanics
	•	Player Interaction Tools
	•	Research & Progression Stratification
	•	Variant Evolution Trees

Each of these will break into multiple sub-systems with tasks.
